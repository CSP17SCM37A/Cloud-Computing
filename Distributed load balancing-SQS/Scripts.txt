This Assignment,i havent run the benchmark using Scripts.I run all the benchmarks Manually.
1.Local System: The Local System Framework code has been written in java. It consists of two parts.one is client side and another is Local BackEnd Workers(Sqs.java).
Execution:
The program is run on Local System.
To execute the program in Linux systems.
First Open terminal and compile the both the programs i.e run the command javac Client.java and java Sqs.java.
To execute the Main programs as follow:
 Client.java:Client .java program can be executed and users would have the choice to enter the Queue name and the local file which contains all the tasks to be executed.
Sqs.Java : Sqs.java program can be executed and users would have the choice to enter the Number of threads for every Benchmark.The number of threads varies 1,2,4,8,16.
2.Remote System:The Remote System Framework code has been written in java. It consists of two parts.one is client side and another is Local BackEnd Workers(Workerrun.java).
Execution:
The program is run on Remote System i.e Amazon Aws.It uses Amazon Resources like Ec2 instances,SQS,S3,DynamoDb.
To execute the program in Linux systems.
First Open terminal and connect to Ec2 instance,then compile the both the programs i.e run the command javac Client.java and  Workerrun.java.
To execute the Main programs as follow:
 Client.java:Client .java program can be executed and users would have the choice to enter the Queue name and the local file which contains all the tasks to be executed.
Workerrun.Java : Workerrun.java program can be executed and users would have the choice to enter the Number of threads for every Benchmark.The number of threads varies 1,2,4,8,16.
